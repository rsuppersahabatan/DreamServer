# Installer Trust And Provenance

Dream Server installers set up Docker services, write local config, generate
secrets, and may install missing prerequisites. Treat them like any other
infrastructure installer: inspect the source, pin a release when you want
reproducibility, and keep the default localhost security posture unless you
intentionally expose services to your LAN.

## Install Paths

### Public Linux/macOS Bootstrap

The README one-liner downloads this bootstrap script from GitHub:

```bash
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Light-Heart-Labs/DreamServer/main/dream-server/get-dream-server.sh
```

That script:

- detects Linux, WSL, or macOS;
- installs or checks basic prerequisites where supported;
- clones `https://github.com/Light-Heart-Labs/DreamServer.git` with sparse
  checkout for the `dream-server/` product tree;
- copies the runtime product files into `~/dream-server`;
- runs `./install.sh` from that copied runtime tree.

By default the bootstrap follows `main`. To pin a release tag or branch, set
`DREAMSERVER_REF` before running the script:

```bash
DREAMSERVER_REF=v2.5.0 bash get-dream-server.sh
```

### Manual Source Install

For the most auditable path, clone a known ref yourself and run the installer
from the checked-out source:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch v2.5.0 https://github.com/Light-Heart-Labs/DreamServer.git
cd DreamServer/dream-server
./install.sh
```

Use this path when you want to review diffs, pin an exact release tag, or make
local modifications before install.

### Windows PowerShell Install

Windows users should install from a normal user PowerShell, not an elevated
Administrator shell:

```powershell
git clone --depth 1 --branch v2.5.0 https://github.com/Light-Heart-Labs/DreamServer.git
cd DreamServer\dream-server
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\install.ps1
```

The PowerShell installer writes runtime state under
`$env:USERPROFILE\dream-server` by default, or `$env:DREAM_HOME` if set.

### Desktop Installer

The Tauri desktop installer is a convenience wrapper around the source
installer flow. For maximum provenance control, prefer the manual source
install above until you have reviewed the desktop installer build you are using.

## Inspect Before Running

If you do not want to pipe a remote script directly into a shell, download and
inspect it first:

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Light-Heart-Labs/DreamServer/main/dream-server/get-dream-server.sh
less get-dream-server.sh
DREAMSERVER_REF=v2.5.0 bash get-dream-server.sh
```

On Windows, clone first and inspect `install.ps1` before running it:

```powershell
git clone --depth 1 --branch v2.5.0 https://github.com/Light-Heart-Labs/DreamServer.git
cd DreamServer\dream-server
notepad .\install.ps1
.\install.ps1
```

## Current Trust Boundary

Dream Server currently relies on:

- GitHub-hosted source and HTTPS transport;
- release tags or explicit refs for reproducible source selection;
- local generated secrets instead of checked-in default credentials;
- localhost-first service binding by default;
- release validation across zero-prereq distro bootstrap, real hardware
  installs, product behavior, full-model capabilities, and lifecycle recovery.

Dream Server does not yet publish a full signed-release or checksum/SBOM chain
for every installer artifact. That is the next stronger trust model. Until then,
users who need strict provenance should install from a reviewed tag or internal
fork and record the exact commit or release tag they deployed.

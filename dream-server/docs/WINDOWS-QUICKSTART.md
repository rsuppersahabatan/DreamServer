# Dream Server Windows Quickstart

## Getting Started

Dream Server is fully supported on Windows 10 2004+ and Windows 11 (NVIDIA and AMD). The installer detects your GPU, selects the right model, downloads it, starts all Docker services, and creates a Desktop shortcut.

**Prerequisites:** [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) with WSL2 backend enabled. NVIDIA GPU or AMD Strix Halo recommended (CPU-only works with smaller models). 4GB+ RAM minimum, 16GB+ recommended.

Open a normal **PowerShell** session and run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
git clone https://github.com/Light-Heart-Labs/DreamServer.git
cd DreamServer
.\install.ps1
```

The installer will:
- Detect your GPU (NVIDIA or AMD) and pick the right model tier
- Download the AI model for your hardware (~1.5GB bootstrap, full model in background)
- Start all Docker services
- Run health checks and create a Desktop shortcut

### Source checkout vs runtime directory

The cloned `DreamServer` folder is only the installer/source checkout. The
Windows runtime is created under `$env:USERPROFILE\dream-server` by default
(or `$env:DREAM_HOME` if you set it before installing). That runtime directory
contains `.env`, generated secrets, model files, logs, data, and the compose
state.

Do not run raw `docker compose` commands from the cloned repository after
installing; Compose will not find the generated `.env` there and relative
volumes will point at the wrong data directory. Use `.\dream.ps1` from the
runtime directory, or `cd $env:USERPROFILE\dream-server` before running manual
Compose commands.

Do not run as Administrator for the normal install. The Windows preflight warns
about this because user-level paths such as `.opencode`, `.env`, and `data/`
can become admin-owned and awkward to manage afterward.

**First-run time:** 10-30 minutes depending on download speed. Bootstrap mode starts chatting in under 2 minutes while the full model downloads in background.

## Quick Commands

Manage Dream Server using `dream.ps1` from your runtime directory:

```powershell
cd $env:USERPROFILE\dream-server

.\dream.ps1 status              # Health checks + GPU status
.\dream.ps1 start               # Start all services
.\dream.ps1 stop                # Stop all services
.\dream.ps1 restart             # Restart all services
.\dream.ps1 logs llama-server   # Tail logs (any service name)
.\dream.ps1 update              # Pull latest images and restart
.\dream.ps1 report              # Generate diagnostics bundle
```

For development installs where you intentionally want the runtime files inside
your working tree, set `DREAM_HOME` before running the installer:

```powershell
$env:DREAM_HOME = "C:\path\to\DreamServer\dream-server"
.\install.ps1
```

Only use this in-place mode if you want `.env`, `data\`, logs, and downloaded
models to live inside that checkout.

## Open the UI

Visit **http://localhost:3000** — the chat interface is ready after the installer completes.

First user becomes admin. Start chatting immediately.

---

## Bootstrap Mode (Faster Start)

The installer automatically uses bootstrap mode when applicable — a small model (~1.5 GB) downloads first so you can start chatting within 2 minutes, while the full model downloads in the background. Hermes-enabled installs run that bootstrap model at a 64K context floor, then promote the full local model context to 128K after the swap. No extra flags needed.

## Installer Flags

| Flag | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| `-Tier 2` | Force specific tier (1-4) |
| `-Voice` | Enable Whisper + TTS |
| `-Workflows` | Enable n8n automation |
| `-Rag` | Enable Qdrant vector DB |
| `-Recommended` | Enable LiteLLM + SearXNG + Token Spy support services |
| `-NoRecommended` | Disable LiteLLM + SearXNG + Token Spy support services |
| `-Hermes` | Enable Hermes Agent |
| `-NoHermes` | Disable Hermes Agent |
| `-NoBootstrap` | Wait for the full model before launching |
| `-OpenClaw` | Enable deprecated OpenClaw legacy agent framework |
| `-Comfyui` | Enable ComfyUI image generation |
| `-Langfuse` | Enable Langfuse LLM observability |
| `-All` | Full stack enabled, except deprecated OpenClaw unless `-OpenClaw` is also passed |
| `-Cloud` | Use cloud LLM provider instead of local |
| `-DryRun` | Simulate install without making changes |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| "Docker not running" | Start Docker Desktop, wait for whale icon |
| "WSL2 not found" | `wsl --install` then restart |
| "nvidia-smi fails" | Update NVIDIA drivers; restart Docker Desktop |
| "Port in use" | Edit `.env`, change `WEBUI_PORT=3001` |
| Out of memory | Lower tier: `.\install.ps1 -Tier 1` |

## System Requirements by Tier

| Tier | VRAM | Model | Use Case |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 8-12GB | 7B Qwen | Basic chat, coding help |
| 2 | 12-20GB | 14B AWQ | Daily driver, good reasoning |
| 3 | 20-40GB | 32B AWQ | Power user, complex tasks |
| 4 | 40GB+ | 72B AWQ | Maximum capability |

## Architecture

```
Windows Host
  ├── Docker Desktop (WSL2 backend)
  │     ├── llama-server container (GPU accelerated)
  │     ├── Open WebUI (port 3000)
  │     ├── SearXNG search
  │     └── PostgreSQL + Qdrant
  └── WSL2 Ubuntu (file system, networking)
```

NVIDIA GPU access: Windows driver → WSL2 → Docker Container Toolkit → llama-server

AMD Strix Halo local inference runs through the Windows host accelerated path
selected by the installer; Docker services reach it through
`host.docker.internal`.

## Files & Locations

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Install directory | `$env:USERPROFILE\dream-server` by default; override with `DREAM_HOME` |
| Config | `.env` file in install directory |
| Models | `$env:USERPROFILE\dream-server\data\models\` |
| Logs | `.\dream.ps1 logs <service>` or `docker compose logs` from the install directory |
| Data | Docker volumes (auto-managed) |

---

## Updating

```powershell
cd $env:USERPROFILE\dream-server
.\dream.ps1 update
```

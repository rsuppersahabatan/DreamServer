# Dream Server Documentation Index

This is the maintained map for operators, contributors, and reviewers. Links from
this directory use `../` for the `dream-server/` product root and bare filenames
for other docs in this directory. The GitHub landing README lives two levels up
at [`../../README.md`](../../README.md).

**FAQ:** `../FAQ.md` is the installation and usage FAQ at the product root;
`FAQ.md` in this directory is the hardware and requirements FAQ.

## Current Truths

- The golden paths are Linux NVIDIA, Windows with Docker Desktop + WSL2 for
  NVIDIA/AMD, and Apple Silicon. Linux AMD Strix Halo is actively supported;
  Intel Arc is present but still experimental.
- The default agent path is Hermes Agent plus `hermes-proxy`. OpenClaw remains
  available for compatibility, but it is deprecated and no longer enabled by
  default.
- Linux Docker installs expose llama-server on host `OLLAMA_PORT=11434` by
  default while containers use `llama-server:8080`. macOS native Metal and
  Windows native/Lemonade paths use host port `8080` unless overridden.
- Windows installs should run from a normal user PowerShell, not Administrator.
  The default install directory is `$env:USERPROFILE\dream-server` unless
  `DREAM_HOME` is set.
- Bundled service truth lives in `extensions/services/*/manifest.yaml`.
  Core host-facing port defaults are tracked in `config/ports.json`; per-service
  manifest defaults live with each service. The dashboard extension library
  catalog is generated into `config/extensions-catalog.json`.
- Generated runtime config has several writers. If you change `.env`,
  OpenCode, Perplexica, Hermes, or LiteLLM/Lemonade behavior, update the Linux,
  macOS, Windows, bootstrap-upgrade, and host-agent paths together.
